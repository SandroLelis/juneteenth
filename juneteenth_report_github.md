### About Juneteenth

<br>

<p>

Juneteenth is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the
emancipation of enslaved African Americans. Deriving its name from
combining “June” and “nineteenth”, it is celebrated on the anniversary
of General Order No. 3, issued by Major General Gordon Granger on June
19, 1865, proclaiming freedom for slaves in Texas.\[7\] Originating in
Galveston, Juneteenth has since been observed annually in various parts
of the United States, often broadly celebrating African-American
culture. The day was first recognized as a federal holiday in 2021, when
President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act
into law after the efforts of Lula Briggs Galloway, Opal Lee, and
others.

<p>

Early celebrations date to 1866, at first involving church-centered
community gatherings in Texas. They spread across the South and became
more commercialized in the 1920s and 1930s, often centering on a food
festival. Participants in the Great Migration brought these celebrations
to the rest of the country. During the Civil Rights Movement of the
1960s, these celebrations were eclipsed by the nonviolent determination
to achieve civil rights, but grew in popularity again in the 1970s with
a focus on African American freedom and African-American arts. Beginning
with Texas by proclamation in 1938, and by legislation in 1979, every
U.S. state and the District of Columbia has formally recognized the
holiday in some way. With its adoption in parts of Mexico, the holiday
has become an international holiday. Juneteenth is celebrated by the
Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped from slavery in
1852 and settled in Coahuila, Mexico.

<p>

Celebratory traditions often include public readings of the Emancipation
Proclamation, singing traditional songs such as “Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing”, and the reading of works by
noted African-American writers, such as Ralph Ellison and Maya Angelou.
Juneteenth celebrations may also include rodeos, street fairs, cookouts,
family reunions, parties, historical reenactments, and Miss Juneteenth
contests. In 2021, Juneteenth became the first new federal holiday since
Martin Luther King Jr. Day was adopted in 1983.

#### Observations:

<br>

There were more lynchings for black individuals from 1880-1936 for posse
mob composition.

The alleged offense most taken was no allegation at all mostly and
according to this dataset there were no more allegations after 1927 for
this group following by murder.

counts were on black race.

### Descriptive Analysis:

<br>

Despite of the unaccurated dataset, this dataset lead us to conclude
that there were significant lychings for white race individuals, mostly
related to outlaws, as we can observe by the circunstaces of the
lychings mostly with a mob composition by “masked men” revealing gang
rivals, “vigilance commitee” revealing lynchings for crime comitted and
escape, “party of texans” revealing rivalry and “band of indians” .

In this analysis it was also excluded white hispanic that were refered
as white race individuals. Although it was noticed that black
individuals suffered the most deaths by lynching in this dataset, we can
observe in the clustering plot that black individuals populate deaths
from cluster 2 to cluster 5, while the remaining races were grouped in
cluster 1 wich have the lowest death rates, and most didn’t had any
allegation, mostly by hangging and shot.
